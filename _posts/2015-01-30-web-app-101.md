Over the past few months, I've helped build two websites:

* [CHKNTNDR](http://chkntndr.com)
* [OHHEY](http://ohhey.me)

I figured I'd help a few people out, including myself, by recording my
steps along the way.

### Setting up Git
This is a *must*.  Even if you're coding solo, you're inevitably going
to want to look back at old versions of code. Or, more likely, you are
going to f' something up and need to return to a previous version of
code.  If you're coding as a team, it's how you'll collaborate.

Here are the first steps to initializing a code base for a new web app:
<br>
<small>My web app is called *alist*, you should fill in the name of
your app accordingly.</small>

On GitHub:

* Create a GitHub account
* Create a new repository
![new repo]({{ site.url }}/assets/new_repo.png)

On your terminal:

* Run 'rails new alist' to create your new rails app.
* 'Cd' into the alist directory. Run 'git init' to initialize your new
  repo.
* Add your remote repo (the repo on GitHub) by running 'git remote add origin git@github.com:username/alist.git'
* Push your blank rails app to GitHub with 'git push origin master.'
