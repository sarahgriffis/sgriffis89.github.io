title: Hello World!
---

Hello there. If you happen to be reading this, *GOOD FOR YOU!* Somehow, you've found a wormhole in the universe and landed on this blog.
You probably have a few questions.

### Who are you?

Well, I'm Sarah.  I like to:

* eat
* drink coffee
* play with big dogs
* code in Python, Ruby (learning!), R

I live in Brooklyn, but I'm from Indiana.  I'm currently on an Amtrak train to Washington, DC.



### What are you going to write about?

Great question.  Maybe food?  Maybe coffee shops?
Maybe dogs?  Probably coding?  Possibly all of the above?


I'm trying out several different blogging systems.
Right now, I'm working with a Jekyll theme called [Lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon#readme).


Thanks for reading!
