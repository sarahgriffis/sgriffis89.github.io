  Who am I?
</p>

I am *not* a trained data scientist, back end web developer, front end web devloper, foodie, cosmopolitan, or curator of the arts.
But I do love to work with numbers, enjoy a solid pizza, and find myself talking about music at least once a day.

  Professional Life
</p>

After studying engineering at Caltech, I worked as a pre-doctoral [LEAP scholar at Harvard University](http://leap.fas.harvard.edu/).
I then transitioned to economic consulting at the Brattle Group.  Currently, I'm a data engineer for [Paperless Post](https://www.paperlesspost.com/).
